### 👩 Personal counseling - Situation in personal relationships
I consulted Ivan about two situations in which I could not see a way out, there was a feeling of deadlock and confusion.
Throughout the whole process of handling the situations, I felt his acceptance, understanding, genuine interest, and gentle contact. I felt safe. This is super important to me. It allowed me to open up, to share my experiences that I hadn't even voiced to the people closest to me.
It gave me a chance to live through the emotions that rose in me. I became aware of them and accepted them. I understood my needs and the needs of the other parties to the conflict.
At the end of each situation, I experienced great relief, peace, joy, and lightness. My body felt as if it was floating.) Inside me, there was an understanding of how to be and what to do next.
After a while, I thought of concrete steps, and I managed to put them into practice! And I was surprised at the result! The quality of my relationship improved! There was understanding and clarity, and my relationship was more caring and intimate than it had been before! And that's what I always wanted)
Thank you ❤️

### 👩 Personal consultation - Conflict situation in the community
Thank you Ivan for the breakdown of a complex (multi-component) situation. The breakdown lasted about 3 hours - looked into the emotions and needs of my sub-personalities, and looked at the emotions and needs of others involved in the situation. It was so hard for me to get away from interpretations and assessments and look for feelings and needs, Ivan did not give up, clarified everything, and helped me look further))

In the end, I very clearly felt the release of something. Words cannot describe this state. It was related not only to the situation but also to my personality. It was cool, unusual, and apt ❤️🌺

PS I loved that Ivan didn't miss anything and even if we veered off course and went off the path, we still got back on it. Thank you, Ivan, for this journey 🌺🕊
