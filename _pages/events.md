Hi!
I starting this online meetings in English.

I would love to share my skills and help people with whom I would like to communicate.
People, who
* wants to have closer relationships with their friends and people around.
* dream to have the courage to speak what they feel and what they want, to be more open and sincere about who they are.
* feel sometimes they are not sure exactly what they really want in particular situations and yes probably sometimes in life in general

I'll help to figure out how to communicate in difficult situations\
when it isn't clear how to act.\
The event will be all about situations you will bring with you,\
I will give theory at a time when it is necessary for understanding.

I lead such meetings on a regular base in Russian.\
My English works. English is not my native language, then it's not perfect but it works.\
For me, it's also language practice.

Why do I do it for free
* It's my art
* I like to master my skill
* I like to practice my English
* I love to see I do something useful for people
* I love to see people become more joyful and peaceful when they see the whole situation from a new point of view
* Maybe I will find clients
* Maybe I will be able to build a community
