### What I do:
I help to build closer and more sincere relationships. Consultations take place in an atmosphere of gentle contact and empathy, which allows you to open up and be understanding of yourself.

### I will help:

* To build sincere and close relationships with friends, and find the courage to talk about your feelings and what really bothers you.

* To find a closer relationship with your best friend, and to understand how to start a conversation.

* To figure out what to do in a conflict situation, and what steps to take.

* To build an equal relationship with a colleague, defend your boundaries and preserve the relationship.

* To be heard, to learn how to talk to be listened to.

#### What my clients get as a result of the consultation:  
Clarity and understanding of the situation, which gives an understanding of what to do next.  
And also a sense of peace and joy that the situation has become clearer.
