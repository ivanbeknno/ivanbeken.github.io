Sometimes what happens to me gives me strength.\
Sometimes what happens adds to my nervousness, feeling tired and apathetic.\
Or is it not something that happens to me, but something that I myself affect?

Often it can be the little things.\
It's easy to ignore the little things. It's easy to ignore them.\
At the same time, the non-big things are what can be done here and now.\
And it's something that can be avoided.\
The little things are what we can control.

For example, I want to go on vacation. An hour of vacation won't suit me, a day of vacation won't suit me either.\
Even a week of vacation doesn't seem like enough.\
I want two weeks. At least. Only then I can rest.

If I'm walking in the desert, thirsty,\
and I want to drink a bucket of water,\
does that mean I'll refuse a glass?\
I don't think so.\
But then why is it like that with vacations?\
I want to vacation a lot. But five minutes, which you can easily carve out during the day, doesn't count as a full rest.\
Much less one minute.\
But it's that one minute that can save you from burnout.\
Perhaps this is so because thirst is hard to ignore. Like the lack of food or air.\
It becomes the only thing you think about.\
And lack of rest, on the other hand, traps you in a cycle of nervousness and apathy.\
Emotional rest is necessary if one wants to live life with pleasure.

I'm not against vacation - vacation is necessary to stay sane.\
But does that mean that you don't need to rest today?

**Another question is whether rest, tranquility, and joy are not external circumstances, but a choice.**\
And this choice can be made at the moment, not necessarily waiting for a vacation.\
Even if this choice is not quite conscious, but rather habitual.\
You can make it more conscious.

How to understand where exactly I made this choice?
One way is to make two lists:\
1. **What helps me feel more calm and enjoyment of life, what gives me joy and excitement?**\
What are my thoughts? What are my actions? What events? What am I doing that makes me feel energized to do even things I don't normally want to do?

2. **What happens that makes me feel nervous, fearful, guilty, discouraged, apathetic?**\
Again - what am I thinking, what am I doing? What is going on in the process? What's bothering me? What's going on that makes me nervous, that I can't come to my\ senses for the rest of the day?

So you can see where I refuse a glass of water, even though I am thirsty.
